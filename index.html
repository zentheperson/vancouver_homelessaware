    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Homelessness is a growing crisis in Metro Vancouver, with the City of Vancouver experiencing the highest share of homeless individuals. 
        <br><br>
        Homelessness is defined as those: 
        <ol>
            <li>"Visible" on the streets or living in hostels</li>
            <li>"Hidden" and reside in temporary or illegal housing</li>
            <li>Immediate danger of becoming homeless</li>
        </ol>
        <P>Vancouver’s homelessness counts show an average increase of 7.7% per year over the past decade, driven by unaffordability issues. Without major intervention, this trend is expected to continue or worsen. </P>

          <div class="impact-text">
            <h4>Individual Impact</h4>
            <p>Social marginalisation, reduced life expectancy, heightened risk of illness and injury, an absence of family relationships, friendships, and social connections.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Social Impact -->

          <div class="impact-text-right">
            <h4>Social Impact</h4>
            <p>Increased healthcare costs, reduced public safety, and strain on social services. 
              <br><br>
              As housing becomes less affordable, more people are pushed towards the brink of homelessness. 
              This means that without systemic changes, anyone facing economic disruption could become homeless.

        <h2>Mapping The Issue</h2>
        <h3>Income and Rent </h3>
        <p>Differences in income and rent are shaping who can afford to stay housed. </p>
        <ol>
          <li>High-income neighborhoods on the West Side comfortably absorb high rental prices </li>
          <li>Likewise, despite having the highest rents, communities in the Centre are often cushioned by higher incomes</li>
          <li>Lower-income communities in the South and East face growing rental pressure. Rents remain moderately high, yet median incomes are significantly lower—pushing many households into precarious situations.</li>
          <li>Districts like Mount Pleasant (East Vancouver) exhibit an emerging income-rent imbalance, rents are rising faster than income growth. </li>
      </ol>

            src=" https://chloezhang625.github.io/stunning-april-winner/"  
            width="100%"  
            height="600px"  
            style="border:none;">
        </iframe>
        <h3>Affordability</h3>
        <p>This disparity becomes even more evident when we look at the issue of <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-229-x/2009001/envir/hax-eng.htm">housing affordability</a>- which is define as spending more than 30% of their income on housing </p>
        <ol>
          <li>In neighborhoods like Marpole, Sunset, and Renfrew-Collingwood, over 40% of renters are paying more than 30% of their income on housing.</li>
          <li>In Downtown Vancouver, nearly all renters are paying over 30% of their income. </li>
        </ol>
          <p>These areas are particularly vulnerable, where even small economic shocks—like job loss or illness—can lead to housing instability. When rent burden becomes chronic and support systems fall short, the risk of eviction and homelessness increases significantly.</p>
          <p>Homelessness is not a standalone issue. It is deeply tied to the geography of affordability, where high housing costs and low incomes intersect to create systemic vulnerability. Mapping these stress points offers not only insight into where homelessness is most likely to emerge—but also where interventions could be most effective.</p>
        <iframe 
            src="  https://chloezhang625.github.io/stunning-may-winner/"  
            width="100%"  
            height="600px"  
            style="border:none;">
        </iframe>
        <h3>Eviction</h3>
        <p>Housing affordability is the second most cited<a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/240412/dq240412c-eng.htm"> reason </a> for evictions. This map represent eviction patterns, highlighting the areas with the highest eviction counts and the age distribution of those affected.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Areas such as Downtown and East Vancouver show high eviction densities, reflected by darker blue zones and dense red dots. </li>
            <li>The majority of evicted individuals are adults, while teenagers and elderly people are less represented.</li>
        </ol>
        <P>This map aligns closely with the previous ones—visualising the outcome of income-rent imbalances and housing affordability stress. While eviction does not always result in homelessness, it heightens the risk dramatically. This further emphasises the need for targeted support in high-risk areas and can inform housing policy, social service allocation, and early intervention strategies to prevent and mitigate homelessness.</P>

        style="border:none;">
        </iframe>

        <h3>Homeless shelters</h3>
        <p>When we examine the city's shelter infrastructure, two key concerns emerge.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Most shelters are concentrated in Downtown and East Vancouver—areas with high eviction counts and known housing stress. Yet, even within these neighborhoods, shelter capacity is insufficient. Shelters are already operating at <strong>97% occupancy</strong>, and the number of shelter beds is not keeping pace with the growing number of people pushed into housing precarity. This creates <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/shelters-turning-away-1.6676762">significant barriers</a> to access, even for those living closest to support services.</li>
          <li>Homelessness is not confined to Downtown or East Vancouver. Eviction risk is city wide, and individuals who are evicted may not remain within the same neighbourhood. They can end up in places far from centralised services. As a result, the concentration of shelters in Downtown means many homeless individuals lack meaningful access to the help they need. This geographical mismatch limits the reach and equity of the city’s homelessness response.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This means that the community plays an important role to provide help for the homeless individuals in their neighbourhood, to make up for the insufficiency in public services.</p>

                <h3>Government Agencies and Organisations</h3>
                <p>By analysing the data presented on the maps and submitted data from homeless individuals, they can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Identify High-Risk Areas:</strong> Pinpoint neighborhoods most at risk of homelessness due to unaffordability, enabling targeted interventions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Provide Tailored Support:</strong> Understand the specific needs and preferences of homeless individuals regarding shelter, food, health services, and more, ensuring resources are allocated where they are most needed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhance Shelter Planning:</strong> Assess shelter capacity and identify factors influencing shelter usage and popularity, enabling better management and expansion of services.</li>
                    <li><strong>Monitor Homelessness Trends:</strong> Track patterns in location and shelter use, helping to address affordability issues and ensure public safety by identifying areas with high concentrations of homelessness.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These insights provide a richer foundation for creating policies that target affordability and prevent homelessness while improving the effectiveness of shelter services and resource allocation.</p>
